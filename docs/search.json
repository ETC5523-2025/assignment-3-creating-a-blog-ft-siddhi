    "text": "Hi, I’m Siddhi Jadhav and I’m studying Business Analytics at Monash University. Most days, you’ll find me somewhere between running R scripts, fixing the same R scripts and promising myself that next time, the code will run perfectly on the first try. It never does but that’s okay. I’ve learned that data analytics is equal parts logic, creativity and chaos and that’s exactly what makes it exciting.\nI spend most of my time working in R, using tools like ggplot2, dplyr and the tidyverse to make sense of messy datasets. There’s something oddly satisfying about turning raw, confusing data into visuals that actually tell a story. Every clean plot feels like a small win usually followed by coffee, because every good analyst knows caffeine counts as part of the workflow.\nOutside of analytics, I’m a big fan of tennis. I like to think of it as the perfect metaphor for what I do you serve, you miss, you adjust and then you try again until you find your rhythm. Whether it’s a rally on the court or debugging loops in R, patience and timing make all the difference.\nWhen I’m not coding or playing tennis, I’m probably exploring new coffee spots around Melbourne or pretending that lo-fi playlists actually help me focus. I love connecting with people who enjoy learning, sharing ideas, or just laughing about the endless adventure that is data analysis."

    "section": "Understanding the data",
    "text": "Understanding the data\nThe analysis is based on modelling by Zachreson et al. (2021), who simulated how changes in variant transmissibility and vaccine performance affected the probability that a quarantine facility might release at least one infected person into the community. Their agent based model was designed around Australian quarantine conditions and compared outcomes for Alpha-like and Delta-like variants under different levels of vaccine efficacy and coverage.\nPut simply, the researchers wanted to know how likely a “breach” was under different vaccine and variant scenarios. The results showed a clear pattern: while vaccination lowers breach risk, Delta’s transmissibility raises the baseline so much that even strong coverage cannot fully cancel out the risk.\nTo illustrate these relationships, Figure 1 below recreates the overall trend using simplified simulated data based on the study’s concepts. It shows how increasing both vaccine efficacy and population coverage reduces breach probability but with diminishing returns once coverage exceeds about 80%..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Structure of the quarantine and testing model used by Zachreson et al. (2021). False negatives and undetected infections can result in breach events where infected individuals enter the community. Adapted from Zachreson et al. (2021, Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, higher coverage and stronger vaccines reduce risk rapidly at first, but the benefits flatten at very high levels. This mirrors the study’s finding that while vaccination helps substantially, Delta’s transmission potential still leaves a small but persistent breach risk even at 90% efficacy.\n?@tbl-thresholds summarises the approximate vaccine coverage required to keep breach probability below 5% under different efficacy and variant scenarios. These numbers are simplified examples but align closely with the trends reported by Zachreson et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of how vaccine efficacy and coverage influence time to 50 % outbreak probability, based on Zachreson et al. (2021, Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy\nCoverage\nt50.days.\n\n\n\n\n60\n≈ 90\n≈ 20\n\n\n75\n≈ 70\n≈ 150\n\n\n90\n≈ 55\n&gt; 1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, ?@fig-breach-prob and ?@tbl-thresholds highlight how variant transmissibility compounds risk. When efficacy drops or new variants spread more easily, the level of vaccination needed to maintain low breach probability increases sharply. In other words, vaccination is essential, but by itself, it isn’t enough to sustain pre-Delta safety levels."

    "section": "What it all means",
    "text": "What it all means\nAccording to Zachreson et al. (2021), vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of quarantine breaches but cannot fully offset Delta’s transmissibility. As viral reproduction rates climb, even small coverage gaps or moderate declines in efficacy cause a disproportionate rise in outbreak risk.\nThe implication is clear: quarantine safety depends on layers of protection, not a single measure. Combining vaccination with frequent testing, proper ventilation and shorter isolation periods creates a resilient system that tolerates uncertainty and limits risk spill-over.\nUltimately, the research underscores a key lesson in public health modelling: Effective pandemic control is not about eliminating risk, but about managing it intelligently. Vaccines remain a cornerstone of defence, but they perform best when integrated with adaptive, evidence-based policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive site\n\n\n\nhttps://etc5523-2025.github.io/assignment-3-creating-a-blog-ft-siddhi/"

    "text": "Analysing the risk\nZachreson et al. (2021) built an agent-based model that reproduced the flow of travellers through testing and isolation under Australian quarantine conditions. It captured the points where infection could remain undetected and later seed community transmission.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the model followed travellers through repeated testing, isolationanddischarge.\nEven with multiple test rounds, false negatives sometimes allowed undetected infections to leave isolation, creating the “breach events” that the study set out to quantify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: False negatives and undetected infections can result in breach events where infected individuals enter the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this framework, the authors simulated how combinations of vaccine efficacy and coverage affected the chance of at least one infected traveller causing an outbreak. The results showed that vaccination greatly reduced risk but could not eliminate it entirely, particularly once transmissibility exceeded Delta levels.\nTo summarise their findings, Table 1 below compiles the approximate thresholds reported in the paper. It shows how higher vaccine efficacy and coverage dramatically increase the time before an outbreak becomes likely, but with diminishing returns beyond roughly 80 percent coverage.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Approximate relationship between vaccine efficacy, coverageandtime to 50 % outbreak probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy (%)\nCoverage (%)\nt₅₀ (days)\n\n\n\n\n60\n≈ 90\n≈ 20\n\n\n75\n≈ 70\n≈ 150\n\n\n90\n≈ 55\n&gt; 1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, Figure 1 and Table 1 illustrate why Delta made quarantine so fragile. High vaccination coverage and potent vaccines reduce breach probability sharply at first, but residual risk persists even at 90 percent efficacy. This means vaccination, while vital, could not single-handedly restore the pre-Delta safety margin."
